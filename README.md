Understanding the mechanisms of leukemicprogression in ASXL1 mutant clonal hematopoiesis through single cell-omics and novel mouse models

#### Tracking Object creation -  
0.<filename>.Rmd - pre-seurat object   
1.<fn>.Rmd - import relevant scripts - creating a run-specific seurat object   
2.<fn>.Rmd - normalization relevant   
3.<fn>.Rmd - cluster identification - I've separated this out from normalization because I'm not sure where it fits best. Also, it's likely to evolve over time.   
4.<fn>.Rmd - integration/merge   
5+ - specific questions? Unnecessary?   
   
Number followed by letters - method evaluations, alternatives, or ???      
For example, 1a creates a summary of the HTO and ADT counts tables that informed 1.ImportQC HTO identification.     
2a, 2b are alternative methods for normalizing the object.
